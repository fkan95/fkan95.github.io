Hi, my name is Florian!

I am a theoretical physicist working on quantum communication and quantum information. I am part of the [QuIT](https://www.quitphysics.info/) group in the Theory Division at the Atominstitute, TU Wien, and the Quantum Group at AIT - Austrian Institute of Technology. My research focuses on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), particularly continuous-variable and high-dimensional QKD, as well as various other topics in quantum information theory, such as (high-dimensional) entanglement.  

My academic journey began in Vienna, where I studied Physics and Mathematics at TU Wien. A summer internship at AIT - Austrian Institute of Technology introduced me to Quantum Key Distribution, sparking my fascination with quantum physics and quantum information theory. This was followed by a research stay in the [QQCT group](https://lutkenhausgroup.wordpress.com/) of Prof. Norbert Lütkenhaus at the Institute for Quantum Computing in Waterloo, Canada, where I worked on finite-size security proofs for Discrete Modulated Continuous-Variable protocols. I then began my PhD with Prof. Marcus Huber in the QuIT group, focusing on high-dimensional entanglement and its applications in QKD protocols, as well as generalisations of QKD to multi-party scenarios.

I am deeply curious about the fundamental laws of nature and enjoy building bridges between foundational principles and their practical applications. Although I am a theorist, I enjoy working closely with experimental groups, as these collaborations not only help translate theoretical insights into practical Experiments, but also deepen my understanding and inspire new theoretical questions.
