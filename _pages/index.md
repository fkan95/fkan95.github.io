Hi,<br>
I am a theoretical physicist working on quantum communication and quantum information. I am part of the <a href="https://www.quitphysics.info/">QuIT group</a> in the Theory Division at the Institute for Atomic and Subatomic Physics, TU Wien, and the Quantum Group at AIT - Austrian Institute of Technology. My research focuses on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), particularly continuous-variable and high-dimensional QKD, as well as various other topics in quantum information theory, such as (high-dimensional) entanglement.  <br> <br>

I am deeply curious about the fundamental laws of nature and enjoy building bridges between foundational principles and their practical applications. Although I am a theorist, I enjoy working closely with experimental groups, as these collaborations not only help translate theoretical insights into practical experiments, but also deepen my understanding and inspire new theoretical questions. <br><br>

My academic journey began in Vienna, where I studied Physics and Mathematics at TU Wien. A summer internship at AIT - Austrian Institute of Technology introduced me to Quantum Key Distribution, sparking my fascination with quantum physics and quantum information theory. This was followed by a research stay in the <a href="https://lutkenhausgroup.wordpress.com/">QQCT group</a> of Prof. Norbert Lütkenhaus at the Institute for Quantum Computing in Waterloo, Canada, where I worked on finite-size security proofs for Discrete Modulated Continuous-Variable protocols. Back in Vienna, I started a PhD with Prof. Marcus Huber in the QuIT group, focusing on high-dimensional entanglement and its applications in QKD protocols, as well as generalisations of QKD to multi-party scenarios, which I finished in December 2025. Currently I am working as Postdoc/Scientist on various topics of quantum information and quantum communication. <br><br>
