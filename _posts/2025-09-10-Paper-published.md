Excited to share that our paper on the composable finite-size security of high-dimensional QKD protocols has been published in Physical Review Applied! This work generalizes our [security proof framework for HD-QKD protocols](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.135.010802) to the finite-size regime, proving security against both collective and coherent attacks for fixed- as well as variable-length protocols. We also show how variable-length security can outperform fixed-length security in realistic atmospheric channels. You can read it [here](https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/abstract/10.1103/v51y-vkfr).
