This Friday, December 12th, I successfully defended my doctoral thesis, titled "Quantum Communication Beyond Qubits." 
Over the past three years, I had the opportunity to work on - and learn a great deal about - quantum key distribution and quantum information theory, while also being challenged to grow far beyond the technical aspects.

I’m eternaly thankful for the opportunity to pursue my PhD in such an encouraging environment: sharing an office with great colleagues who have become friends, and collaborating with and learning from so many inspiring and brilliant people from all over the world!
My sincere thanks go to everyone who supported me along the way, especially my supervisors, Marcus Huber and Christoph Pacher, for their invaluable guidance, dedicated supervision, and support, and to my PhD peers for the wonderful handcrafted hat - a truly memorable gift!
